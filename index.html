            <h1>About Me</h1>
          </div>
          <p>
            I am Leah Lamorin, a BSCS student from UIC. I was born and raised in
            Davao. Ive always been passionate about learning and trying new
            things, which I enjoyed about being in challenging life events. Ive
            always dreamt of being part of the Google Developer Team, which made
            the UIC likely a dream. In my first year of college, I was a part of
            the GDSC, which helped me reach various activities and programs that
            opened our minds to communicating and helped me adopt new learning
            and skills that I could practice and master

          <h3>My Talents</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Dancing allows me to connect with music that has an impact on my body,
          minds, and thoughts. I've learned a lot about life, myself, and how to
          listen to and comprehend my emotions by means of dance. Also, My
          favorite sport is volleyball since it's an ideal means to have fun and
          stay active. It's a fun activity to play since it requires working
          together, communicating, and strategy.
